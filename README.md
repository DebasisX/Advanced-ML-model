# Advanced-ML-model
Adaptive Hierarchical Classification Model with Dynamic Ranging.


This is going to be quite an intensive project, as I am working solo.
So I wouldn't try to hurry it up. Till now the template is ready and have updated the PDF
mentioning the conditions where the model has to learn some anomalies. 

This currently supports training and testing on single inputs, it is a multiple output classifier model.

Example usage:

Get yourself a dataset.csv with io pairs.
and place it in dataset/dataset.csv.

Go into the model dir,
run ./model.exe

Test on different inputs.
Thank You.
